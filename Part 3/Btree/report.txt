We tried to unpin pages as soon as they were no longer in use. Essentially, only one pin should be pinned at a time (the current page). This takes a lot of effort from the deconstructor and frees up more space in the buffer. For a range  search, we avoid unnecessarily traversing the tree again by simply examining the next value. The next value is returned if it fits the search, or an exception is thrown if it does not.

If the tree were to allow duplicate values, insertEntry would need to be changed. Currently the way the program determines where within a leaf to insert a new value depends on the new value not being equal to any existing values, so incorrect behavior would occur if a new value were already in the tree. The logic would simply need to change to <= and >= to correct for this.
