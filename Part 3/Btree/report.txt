Constructor:
Not much optimization in this method. Entries were just added as the scanner brought them in.

Deconstructor:
All tree pages needed to be unpinned before the index file could be flushed. Because of our design choices
in other methods, the only page that needed to be unpinned was the current page in the scan.
